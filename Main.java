/* I just added the Book file to read the records from the csv file, and then the book Demo 
file puts them into a object and prints them out. I added the task11 to display everything
in the assignment up to question 11. The task11Loader is what helps run the code so I need 
both of the files. */

/* the code needs to be ran in the terminal so to run the task 11 file I ran the following 
in the terminal, javac Task11.java Book.java Task11Loader.java
then java Task11.
